I used YOLOv8 model from Ultralytics, optimized for Google Colab.
The code leverages ultralytics for YOLOv8 and opencv-python for image processing. It includes functions to detect objects in an image, display results with bounding boxes and labels in Colab, and save the annotated outputs with timestamps.
The pre-trained YOLOv8m model (medium variant) is used for detecting objects across 80 COCO dataset classes.
